    "## **Forest Covertype**\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: **Classification** of forest land areas into 7 cover types based on attributes such as elevation, aspect, slope, hillshade, soil-type, and more.\n",
    "Dataset available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype).\n",
    "### **General Information**\n",
    "Predicting forest cover type from cartographic variables only (no remotely sensed data). The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data. Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.\n",

    "All input data is in raw form (not centered/scaled). Given below is the attribute name, data type, measurement unit and a brief description of all available input parameters.\n",

    "Your task is to build machine learning (ML) pipelines for classification on different subsets of the forest cover type dataset using the user interface (UI) provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **UI** consists of **two sections**:\n",
    "1. **Subset Selection:** Select a data subset (`Subset A`, `Subset B` or `Subset C`) using the drop down menu.\n",
    "2. **ML Pipeline:** Build your pipeline using the settings provided in this section. \n",

    "Your ML pipelines consist of the following steps:\n",
    "- Data Preparation\n",
    "- Input Feature Selection\n",
    "- Model Selection\n",
    "- Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "In each step, play around with the available settings and answer the respective questions in the [Bonus Points Quiz](https://learn.boku.ac.at/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1904109) on BOKU Learn.\n",
